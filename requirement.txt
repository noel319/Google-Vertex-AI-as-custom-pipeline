Python script written. Just need it debugged and deployed to Google Vertex AI as custom pipeline. Currently, there's an issue with JSON formatting and metadata read errors for deployment.

Key Tasks:
- Debug Python script
- Test script on local/approve of functions
- Deploy to Google Vertex AI

- MUST HAVE GOOD RESPONSE TIME! YOU WILL BE ARCHIVED AFTER 5 MINUTES OF NO RESPONSE.

Please note that I am only able to consider applicants based in the US.




Here's workflow that I need for AI model:

Yes so this script is programmed to create websites with AI. I have added about 225 templates to a dataset in Vertex AI and here is the process:

1. OpenCV/LayoutLM will select a template file based on the user data input

2. YOLO will detect the images in the website template file

3. Pexels API will change the detected images to images related to the user data input (Industry)

4. T5 will then change the written content of the website relative to user input data and add 'Made with AI by Carrot' at the footer

5. Website will be deployed to a subdomain

That's all for AI tool

Once its deployed, we can connect the reseller API with the AI tool so that it grabs a subdomain/domain if they purchase

Please also change 'analyze_layoutlm():' to 'analyze_opencv():' as we will be using OpenCV instead of LayoutLM
